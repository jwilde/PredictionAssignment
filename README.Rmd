## Summary

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. The data for this project come from the source http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 

It is described how the model was built, how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is and why the choices were made in this kind of way.
